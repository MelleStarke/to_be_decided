    "Autonomous agents often learn from *rewards* (= positive or negative feedback quantities, i.e. this term includes rewards and punishments). In this set-up, the environment is considered a blackbox that returns a *reward* after an agent performs an *action*. In a typical setup rewards are the only thing agents know about their environment. This is the subject matter of reinforcement learning. \n",

    "We provide the environment `EvidenceEnv` that has a hidden world state (`0` or `1`). The task of the agent is to guess the right hidden world state, and the agent will receive a reward of `+1` or `-1` based on whether the guess was right or wrong respectively. The agent gets *evidence* from `EvidenceEnv` for being able to make an informed guess. The generated evidence is *equal* to the true state with probability $p$, and different from the true state with probability $1-p$. \n",
