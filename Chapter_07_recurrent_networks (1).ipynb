    "We will apply two recurrent neural networks to learn a dynamic variant of the *adding problem*. First, run the next cell and check the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a stream of inputs to the network, two at each time step. The first input unit will receive a series of decimal numbers in the interval $[-1,1]$. The second input unit will receive the numbers $0$, $-1$, and $1$. The target is the sum of the preceding two decimal numbers that came together with the number $1$ (called the marker, `x` in the generated output), and it should be produced whenever a marker has been seen. In the beginning until two of these markers have been seen, the input will stay 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find several functions: \n",
    "1. `create_addition_data`: Generates sequential training data sets `X` and `T` for the dynamic *adding problem*, returns a `TupleDataset` for `chainer`.\n",
    "1. `SequentialIterator`: An `Iterator` determines in which order to traverse a training data set. If you have separate individual examples it is best to use a random order. As our data set is sequential, we need to go through it from beginning to end, which is what we implement in this custom `Iterator`. \n",
    "1. `train_model`: A function that takes your model definition and the generated data, and trains the parameters accordingly.\n",
    "4. `Regressor`: Structure for defining a regression problem. Calls a `predictor` (model doing regression) with an input and returns the error between its output and the desired output. \n",
